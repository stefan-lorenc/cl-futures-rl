# cl-futures-rl

This project is my first foray into reinforcement learning and securities visualization. This aim isto develop a reinforcemnt learning environment to trade oil futures with respect to regular market conditions like slippage and comissions. The model is generated through a custom open-ai gym environment and executions and improvements to the algorithm are visualized through tensorboard and plotly in the browser.
